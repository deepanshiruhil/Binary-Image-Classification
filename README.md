# Binary-Image-Classification

Image classification of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) entails training a deep learning model to discern between images depicting cats and dogs. The CNN architecture typically comprises multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers autonomously extract and learn pertinent features (such as edges, textures, and shapes) from input images.

The process involves:
1. **Data Preparation:** Collecting and preprocessing labeled images of cats and dogs (including resizing, normalization, and augmentation).
2. **Model Construction:** Designing a CNN with layers tailored to detect visual features.
3. **Training**: Providing the model with training data and adjusting weights using backpropagation and an optimizer such as Adam.
4. **Evaluation:** Testing the model on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy.
5. **Prediction**: Utilizing the trained model to classify novel images as either cat or dog.

CNNs excel in this task due to their capacity to automatically learn spatial hierarchies within images.
